## Project Overview
This project is a class assignment to create a website dedicated to managing
movies and actors using a SQL database, and uses an AI API to write reviews for
the movies and comments about the actors. The webpage is built using ASP.NET
Core Web Application (Model-View-Controller) in C# and is published to Azure.

## Assignment Requirements
1. **Setup a GitHub repository for the project**
2. **Create the project in Visual Studio as an ASP.NET Core Web Application (Model-View-Controller) [C#]**
3. **Create an Azure OpenAI API resource in Azure**
4. **Create an Azure SQL Server and SQL Database in Azure**
5. **Build the website and integrate the SQL Server, Azure OpenAI API, and VaderSharp2 for sentiment analysis**
6. **Publish the site to Azure**

## Website Requirements
- All CSS and JS code must be contained within their respective files
- Use SRI hashes for all externally linked resources
- Use secrets manager for all sensitive information (API key, credentials)
- Use View Models to bring reviews and other information into the details pages
- Style the site beyond the basic HTML / Razor
- No errors of any kind in the developer tools console
- **Bonus** Use DataTables to manage all tables and present Movie-Actor
  connections in details pages

        - The analyzed sentiment of the tweets

For this assignment's preparation, the author has utilzied *Claude* (3.5
Sonnet), a language model created by *Anthropic*. Within this assigment, Claude
was used to assist in development of the AIService class, integration of AI
API calls, integration of the ViewModels into controllers and views, overall
site css styling, and implementing the async loading for the AI API section of
the details pages.
